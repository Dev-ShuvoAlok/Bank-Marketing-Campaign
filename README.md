#Approach

- Import data from dataset and perform initial high-level analysis: look at the number of rows, look at the missing values, look at dataset columns and their values respective to the campaign outcome.
- Clean the data: remove irrelevant columns, deal with missing and incorrect values, turn categorical columns into dummy variables.
- Use machine learning techniques to predict the marketing campaign outcome and to find out factors, which affect the success of the campaign.
